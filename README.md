# TranscribeSTT
A website that implements a PyTorch model that transcribes user audio inputs (English) to text. 

The PyTorch model used is the pre-trained "WAV2VEC2_ASR_BASE_960H" model.

This project uses the Python programming language and leverages PyTorch for the speech-to-text model and FastAPI for the backend.

The website can be accessed here:

(NOTE: Only the frontend has been deployed. The website currently has no functionality.)
