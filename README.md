# TranscribeSTT
A website that implements a PyTorch model that transcribes user audio inputs (English) to text. 

The PyTorch model used is the pre-trained "EMFORMER_RNNT_BASE_LIBRISPEECH" model.

This project uses the Python programming language and leverages PyTorch for the speech-to-text model and FastAPI for the backend.
